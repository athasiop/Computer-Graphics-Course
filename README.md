# Computer-Graphics-Course
Project done on computer graphics university course

This project had 3 parts. 
1)We were asked to create 2 algorithms for colouring triangles. One was flat colouring and the other one was gouraud(with interpolation between peaks). After creating these algorithms we coloured an array of given triangles to create a duck.
2)We made algorithms to photograph the duck and then colour it. Also we implemented affine transforms.
3)We implemented lighting.
